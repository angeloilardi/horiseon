# horiseon


## Description

The goal of thid project is to make the existing Horiseon page adhere to accessibility standards. This is achieved by:

- using semantic HTML wherever possible
- shaping up the HTML structure so that it follows a logical structure
- adding alt attributes to image and icon elements
- using headings in sequential order 

Horiseon will have a page that is accessible to a wider audience and that will have a higher ranking on search engines.

The code has also been optimized by condensing CSS.
